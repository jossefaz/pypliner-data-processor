The aim of this project is to allow a great modularity in the development of data processes based on the execution sequence of scripts.</p>
<p>The original idea was to provide a central script that would receive as input a configuration file, from which it would be able to import and execute the different scripts.</p>
<p>The power of this tool lies in the fact that it allows to inject the result of a given script to a target script as a parameter. All this based only on the simple configuration file (JSON).</p>
